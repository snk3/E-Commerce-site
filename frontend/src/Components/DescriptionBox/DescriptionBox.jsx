                We continue to showcase the full range of Bounteous x Accolite capabilities, the BxA BT team has been setting up 
                more than a dozen meetings, both virtual and in-person, connecting our BxA leadership with BT chief executives and 
                directors. As of May 2024, the synergy team is actively pursuing at least 10 opportunities, three of which have 
                advanced to the proposal presentation stage. We're harnessing Bounteous capabilities across XD, Marketo, Managed 
                Services, and Salesforce. We're thrilled to be able to bring an expanded range of capabilities to our clients, 
                enabling us to better address their diverse goals and needs across their organizations. Thank you to the BT and 
                Growth teams for pushing this work forward to success!
